I am Ying Su, assistant professor at Software Engineering Department, South China University of Technology since Oct 2025. I obtained my PhD degree in IIP(AI) program at HKUST from Sep 2020 to Jan 2025, advised by [Prof.Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) and [Prof.Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/group.html). I graduated from Tsinghua University with Bachelor's degree in Electric and Electornic Engineering from Aug 2012 to Jul 2016. Previously, I worked as a machine learning engineer at iFlyTek and Baidu AIG from Jan 2017 to Jun 2020.
